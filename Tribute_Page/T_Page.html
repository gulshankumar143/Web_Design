                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India.
                    Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to
                    mathematical
                    analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to
                    mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.

            <h3><u>Here's a time line of Ramanujan's life:</u></h3>
            <ul id="list">
                <li><b>1887</b> - Ramanujan was born into a Tamil Brahmin Aiyangar family in Erode, Madras Presidency
                    (now Tamil Nadu, India),
                    at the residence of his maternal grandparents.
                </li>
                <li><b>1892</b> - Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school. After his maternal grandfather lost his
                    job as a court
                    official in Kanchipuram, Ramanujan and his mother moved back to Kumbakonam and he was enrolled in
                    Kangayan Primary School.
                </li>
                <li><b>1902</b> - As a child prodigy at the age of 14 Ramanujan received merit certificates and academic
                    awards that continued throughout his school career.
                    He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry
                    and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations where he developed his own
                    method to solve the quartic.
                </li>
                <li><b>1910</b> - After a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the Indian
                    Mathematical Society, V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, Ramanujan began to get recognition in Madras's
                    mathematical circles, leading to his
                    inclusion as a researcher at the University of Madras.
                </li>
                <li><b>1912</b> - Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society,
                    where he elaborate his work on
                    elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, divergent series & other series as well. <a
                </li>
                <li><b>1913</b> - Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and E. W. Middlemast tried to present Ramanujan's work
                    to British mathematicians.
                    The first two professors, H. F. Baker and E. W. Hobson, returned Ramanujan's papers without
                    comment.On 16 January 1913 Ramanujan wrote to G. H. Hardy.On 8 February 1913 Hardy wrote Ramanujan a
                    letter expressing interest in his work,
                    adding that it was "essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions".
                </li>
                <li><b>1914</b> - Most of British mathematician rejected his work as there was no prove, but Dr. Hardy &
                    Littlewood encourage him and started his life as mathematician
                    next to Dr. Hardy in Cambridge.
                </li>
                <li><b>1916</b> - After his great struggle for recognition he was able to elected to the London
                    Mathematical Society by submitting 50 page long unusual research paper.
                </li>
                <li><b>1917</b> - On 6 December he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
                </li>
                <li><b>1918</b> - He was elected "for his investigation in Elliptic functions and the Theory of
                    Numbers." On 13 October 1918 he was the first Indian to be elected as Fellow of Trinity College.
                </li>
                <li><b>1919</b> - At the age of 32 he died of plague.
                </li>
                <li><b>Achievements</b> - Ramanujan's contribution on infinite series is unimaginable. His books were
                    kept in museum where his works are yet to be understand. All of his work gave a tremendous value to
                    mathematics. Some of recent scientist believes that his equations could solve the mystery of black
                    hole.
                    Though it is hypothetical.
